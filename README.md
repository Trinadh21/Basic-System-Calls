ASSUMPTIONS MADE OR JUSTIFICATION FOR THE OUTPUT OF PROGRAM:

# *****Some times the cursor might wait for a while even when the write is done in Q1 please wait for 20sec until the complete process is done(The complete program will take less than 20sec) PLEASE WAIT FOR THE PROGRAM TO END IT WILL ONLY TAKE 20SEC FOR 1GB FILE Thanks in advance for your PATIENCE.
# If the current directory has a file named "Assignment" then the program terminates because linux doesnot support have samenamed files or directories in a single directory. KINDLY DELETE THE FILE NAMEED "Assignment" AND PROCESS THE PROGRAM. In the second question if such a case errupts then the program will continue after mentioning that the directory doesnt exist.
# The Assignment Directory is created in the same directory as the current program is getting executed irrespective of its location.
# If the Output file already exists then the file is overwritten and its contents are completely cleared only after that the new files reiprocal are being written into the output file this is done so that we get desired end result
# In addition to the lines mentioned there are 2 additional lines printed to stdout to makesure whether the newfile and outputfile really given exists in the program
# In the second question if the file itself is not there then its permission are not printed
# Although the programs seem to contain many libraries I only used the methods or keywords which are mentioned in the assignment pdf given in the moodle
# The permissions are printed only if the newfile, oldfile are files and directory is not a file, they are not printed it samenamed directory exists incase of files and files in case of directory.
# In Q2 every error message is clearly stating why the error messages occured like the named argument exist but is not what is intended to be.
# One of the main assumption is running computer has atlest 1MB of main memory for the program.
